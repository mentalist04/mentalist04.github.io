<p>For some, <strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-text-editors"target="_blank" title="html5">Sublime Text</a></strong> sets the bar when it comes to text editors. It’s a beautiful feature-rich text editor for editing code that puts a premium on user experience. Its features include a distraction-free writing mode, and split editing, in addition to quick shortcuts and search.</p>

<p><p style="margin-top:45px;"> Speaking of which, there’s a whole host of keyboard shortcuts that let you do anything from opening files to showing and hiding the sidebar, duplicating lines, going to a specific line number, opening the spell checker and – well – you get the idea. Like Atom, Sublime has an incredibly active repository that will be adding new features long after you’ve made the initial download.</p>
